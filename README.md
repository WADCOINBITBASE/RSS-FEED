firefox-feedly-rss
==================

Adds Feedly Cloud Reader as an option in Firefox's Subscribe dialog

Created with [Mozilla Add-On SDK](https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/developers/docs/sdk/latest/ "Mozilla Add-On SDK")

Known Issues
------------

* If Mozilla adds a Feedly handler with the same name, this will likely conflict.
* If you set Feedly to "Always Use" in the subscribe dialog, then disable/remove the extension, it will still be used until Firefox restarts. After that, the option will reset.
